This is a simple runescape username availablity checker that I made for fun :)

This program requires requests, if you dont already have it installed (It might be default) you install it by using the command "pip install requests" in command prompt 

This program is still not fully developed, as it false flags on innappropriate names and some others (unsure why)
Still, it can help you narrow down your search!
